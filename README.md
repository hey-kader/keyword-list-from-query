# Get keywords for any google search

## How it works:
Asks user for input, and scrapes the first 10 google search results for the query. This can be used as an on-page SEO tool. Running the program before writing an article is useful to keep relevant words in the back of your head. You can also run the script on your current web page to compare the verbage to that of the top search results. 

## To run the script:
### (if you do not have the following modules installed)
```
$ pip3 install requests
$ pip3 install bs4
```
### Otherwise, run ```$ python3 links.py``` and enjoy!
